Useful sample codes I have used for Data Mining

The majority of the contents are from the online Udemy courses with some explanatory comments I added to remind myself.
The courses are offered by Kirill Eremenko, who is a professional data scientist I admire. Feel free to check his co-founded website: https://www.superdatascience.com/
